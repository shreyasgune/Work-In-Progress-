# C_C-

A collection of C / C++ programs that I just write to test out some data structures. It's not a project of any kind.

## Installation
I could tell you all about it but it's already been covered [here](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/112/resources/installingEclipse/cygwin/)

## Usage
Since you're using cygwin , you're basically going to use a bit of Unix commands.
```
$ g++-4.9.2 -std=c++14 <your_program>.cpp
$ ./<compiled_program>.exe
```
